<h2>Sunday 16th June 2024, Room Don Alberto 3, Afternoon Sessions, Mexico time:</h2>
 <ul>
  <li>2:00 -3:30 session 1 </li>
  <li>3:30 -4:00 Break </li>
  <li>4:00 -5:30 session 2 </li>
 </ul>

<h2>Abstract:</h2>
<p> In this tutorial, we overview the cutting edge research on spatial and temporal language understanding and the applications. This includes the way the spatial and temporal semantics are represented, the existing datasets and annotations, the connection between information extraction models, qualitative reasoning based on spatial and temporal language and end-to-end deep learning models. We overview the recent large language-models used for spatial and temporal language comprehension, their evaluation and related limitation and challenges. We clarify the role of spatial and temporal language in downstream applications. We highlight applications such as  Grounding language in visual world in navigation and way finding agents as well as human machine interaction and situated dialogue systems.  We overview the research on events temporal relationships and the extraction of event timelines.</p>

<p>Michigan State University, kordjams@msu.edu</p>

<p>Parisa Kordjamshidi is Assistant Professor of Computer Science Department at Michigan State University.  Her research interests are in Natural language Processing and Machine Learning. She has been working on spatial semantics extraction and annotation schemes, mapping language to formal spatial representations, spatial ontologies, structured output prediction models for information extraction, combining vision and language for spatial language understanding. She was awarded an NSF CAREER award in Feb 2019 to work on combining learning and reasoning for spatial language understanding. She is working on Neuro-symbolic modeling and integration of domain knowledge in neural models. She is the PI of an ONR project on  integration of domain knowledge in learning as well as Compositional Generalization in Combining Vision and Language. Further related to the topic of this tutorial, she has been organizing/co-organizing shared tasks on Spatial role labeling, SpRL-2012, SpRL-2013 and the Space Evaluation workshop, SpaceEval-2015, in SemEval Series and Multimodal spatial role labeling workshop mSpRL at CLEF-2017 with the goal of considering  vision  and  language  media  for spatial information extraction and organized SpLU-2018, and Robonlp-SpLU-2019, SpLU-2020 collocated with NAACL-18, NAACL-2019 and EMNLP-2020 respectively.</p>

<p>James Pustejovsky is  the  TJX  FeldbergChair in Computer Science at Brandeis University,  where  he  is  also  Chair  of  the  Linguistics Program, Chair of the Computational Linguistics MA Program, and Director of the Lab for Linguistics and Computation. He received his B.S. from MIT and his Ph.D. from UMASS at Amherst. He has worked on computational and lexical semantics for 25 years and is chief developer of Generative Lexicon Theory. Since  2002, he has been working on the development of a platform for temporal reasoning in language, called TARSQI(www.tarsqi.org). Pustejovsky is chief architect of TimeML and ISO-TimeML, a recently adopted ISO standard for temporal information in language, as well as the recently adopted standard, ISO-Space, a specification for spatial information in language. He has developed a modeling framework for representing linguistic expressions and interactions as multimodal simulations. This platform, VoxML, enables real-time communication between humans and computers or robots for joint tasks, utilizing speech, gesture, gaze, and action. He is currently working with robotics researchers in HRI to allow the VoxML platform to act as both a dialogue management system as well as a simulation environment that reveals realtime epistemic state and perceptual input to a computational agent. His areas of interest include: Computational semantics, temporal and spatial reasoning, language annotation for machine.</p>
