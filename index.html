<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Understating spatial semantics expressed in natural language can become highly complex in real-world applications. This includes applications of language grounding, navigation, visual question answering, and more generic human-machine interaction and dialogue systems. In many of such downstream tasks, explicit representation of spatial concepts and relationships can improve the capabilities of machine learning models in reasoning and deep language understanding. In this tutorial, we overview the cutting-edge research results and existing challenges related to spatial language understanding including semantic annotations,  existing corpora, symbolic and sub-symbolic representations, qualitative spatial reasoning, spatial common sense, deep and structured learning models.  We discuss the recent results on the above-mentioned applications --that need spatial language learning and reasoning -- and highlight the research gaps and future directions.</p>

<p>Parisa Kordjamshidi is Assistant Professorof Computer Science Department at Michigan State University.  Her research interestsare in NLP and Machine learning. She has been working on spatial semantics extractionand annotation schemes, mapping language to formal spatial representations, spatial ontologies, structured output prediction models for information extraction, combining visionand language for spatial language understand-ing. She has been organizing/co-organizingshared tasks on Spatial role labeling, SpRL-2012, SpRL-2013 and the Space Evaluationworkshop, SpaceEval-2015, in SemEval Series and Multimodal spatial role labeling workshop mSpRL at CLEF-2017 with the goal of considering  vision  and  language  media  forspatial information extraction and organizedSpLU-2018 and Robonlp-SpLU collocated with NAACL-18 and NAACL-2019 respectively.</p>
<h3>James Pustejovsky</h3>
<p>Brandeis University</p>
<p>jamesp@cs.brandeis.edu</p>
<p>James Pustejovsky is  the  TJX  FeldbergChair in Computer Science at Brandeis University,  where  he  is  also  Chair  of  the  Linguistics Program, Chair of the Computational Linguistics MA Program, and Director of the Lab for Linguistics and Computation. He received his B.S. from MIT and his Ph.D. from UMASS at Amherst. He has worked on computational and lexical semantics for 25 years and is chief developer of Generative Lexicon Theory. Since  2002, he has been working on the development of a platform for temporal reasoning in language, called TARSQI(www.tarsqi.org). Pustejovsky is chief architect of TimeML and ISO-TimeML, a recently adopted ISO standard for temporal information in language, as well as the recently adopted standard, ISO-Space, a specification for spatial information in language. He has developed a modeling framework for representing linguistic expressions and interactions as multimodal simulations. This platform, VoxML, enables real-time communication between humans and computers or robots for joint tasks, utilizing speech, gesture, gaze, andaction. He is currently working with robotics researchers in HRI to allow the VoxML platform to act as both a dialogue management system as well as a simulation environment that reveals realtime epistemic state and perceptual input to a computational agent. His areas of interest include: Computational semantics, temporal and spatial reasoning, language annotation for machine.</p>
